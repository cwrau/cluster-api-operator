# Basic Cluster API Provider Installation

In this section, we will walk you through the basic process of installing Cluster API providers using the operator. The Cluster API operator manages six types of objects:

- CoreProvider
- BootstrapProvider
- ControlPlaneProvider
- InfrastructureProvider
- AddonProvider
- IPAMProvider

Please note that this example provides a basic configuration of Azure Infrastructure provider for getting started. More detailed examples and CRD descriptions will be provided in subsequent sections of this document.
